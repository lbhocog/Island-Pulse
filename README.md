Reaching out to those without ability to pay: Free medical advise; Medical Practice guidelines
This is a personal mission by a medical professional to extend Free medical advise to those who cannot afford
to pay for medical consultation. Goal is to create an interactive website to be able to get individual medical history 
and be able to return written medical advise for individuals to help them with their own personal medical concerns.
Medical care costs prohibit poor people from getting medical advise. The ideal website would be easy to use, have forms 
capacity to enter medical information, be HIPPA compliant for privacy, be able to link to external medical resources, 
have audio and video capacity. The site will be supported and upgraded from client donation. The client donation should 
be able to link to a bank account and have credit card payment capacity.

magagement of Diabetes and Depression and Anxiety. The medical app shall be compatible with all major formats including 
Windows, Linux, Apple, samsung etc. The project will be funded by sale of this software. Proceed of sales will be used to 
software updates, medical content updates and improve software design.
